This is the code and data for our paper "Learning data streams with changing distributions and temporal dependency" under-reviewed in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems.

Run main.m in matlab to see the results.

The code has been tested in MATLAB R2020b. It should work for most MATLAB versions. If you could not run successfully, please try to comment DAR-SVR/DAR-tree and only run DAR-linear.

If you have any problem, please contact Yiliao Song via yiliao.song@gmail.com
